<h1>Installing Active Directory in Azure</h1>
This lab demonstrates the steps I took to install Active Directory using Azure. I will be using this as the foundation for labs I will do in the future. I will be using two VMs on Azure that are on the same vnet. This particular lab will focus on just one of the VMs, which will be used to install Active Directory and configured to be the domain controller. The other VM will be used as a client that will join later in a future lab. <br />
